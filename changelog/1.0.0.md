# ✨ DreamHud v1.0.0 — Initial Beta Release

> *Released on*: October 2025  
> *Codename*: **"Aurora Layer"** ✨

---

## 🌙 Overview

This is the **first public beta release** of **DreamHud** (formerly known as *HudLib*).  
It introduces the foundation of a new rendering library designed to build advanced, dynamic, and layered HUDs using Paper’s bossbar system.

DreamHud allows developers to design pixel‑perfect overlays, custom fonts, and reactive UI elements directly in Minecraft — all fully API‑driven.

## 🚀 Highlights

### 🧩 Core System
- Added a fully modular **HUD rendering engine** based on Paper bossbars.  
- Introduced the `Hud`, `Layout`, and `Element` abstraction layers.  
- Built-in support for multiple HUD layers with **z-index prioritization**.  
- Designed a **lightweight tick system** for smooth updates and minimal performance cost.

### 🎨 Visual System
- Support for **custom fonts** and **negative-space characters** from resource packs.  
- Added background support for layouts (`.background(String)` in `LayoutBuilder`).  
- Added real-time text updates via **`Supplier<String>`** functions.  
- Implemented **Adventure Component integration** for full color and style support.

### 🧠 API Features
- Public service system: `HudService` (retrieved via `DreamHud.getService()`).  
- Added `HPlayer` and `BarHud` as internal management structures.  
- Introduced `TranslatableElement` for locale-based rendering.  
- Fully compatible with **Java 17+** and **Paper 1.20 → 1.21**.

### 🧪 Developer Tools
- Debug mode showing HUD layout calculations.  
- Example plugins added: `BasicExample` and `AdvancedExample`.  
- Developer-friendly API with full builder patterns and immutability.

## 🐛 Known Issues

- ⚠️ Some font rendering inconsistencies can occur if resource pack characters are missing.  
- ⚠️ Overlapping HUDs may visually blend when using the same background texture.  
- ⚠️ The update tick interval currently applies globally per bar (per-player customization planned).

## 🔮 Roadmap for v1.1.0

- [ ] Add per-HUD tick rate customization.  
- [ ] Add support for animated elements (frame-based).  
- [ ] Implement JSON-based HUD definition loading.  
- [ ] Expose `BarHud` overlays via API.  
- [ ] Improve performance when hundreds of players use unique HUDs.
